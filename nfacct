# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Requirements:
#
# The bash completion package version 2.0 or greater is recommended.
# https://github.com/scop/bash-completion
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Installation (quote from bash-completion README):
#
# Install it in one of the directories pointed to by
# bash-completion's pkgconfig file variables.  There are two
# alternatives: the recommended one is 'completionsdir' (get it with
# "pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion") from which
# completions are loaded on demand based on invoked commands' names,
# so be sure to name your completion file accordingly, and to include
# for example symbolic links in case the file provides completions
# for more than one command.  The other one which is present for
# backwards compatibility reasons is 'compatdir' (get it with
# "pkg-config --variable=compatdir bash-completion") from which files
# are loaded when bash_completion is loaded.
#
# For packages using GNU autotools the installation can be handled
# for example like this in configure.ac:
#
#  PKG_CHECK_VAR(bashcompdir, [bash-completion], [completionsdir], ,
#    bashcompdir="${sysconfdir}/bash_completion.d")
#  AC_SUBST(bashcompdir)
#
# ...accompanied by this in Makefile.am:
#
#  bashcompdir = @bashcompdir@
#  dist_bashcomp_DATA = # completion files go here
#
# For cmake we ship the bash-completion-config.cmake and
# bash-completion-config-version.cmake files. Example usage:
#
#  find_package(bash-completion)
#  if(BASH_COMPLETION_FOUND)
#    message(STATUS
#      "Using bash completion dir ${BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR}")
#  else()
#    set (BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR "/etc/bash_completion.d")
#    message (STATUS
#      "Using fallback bash completion dir ${BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR}")
#  endif()
#
#  install(FILES your-completion-file DESTINATION
#    ${BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR})
#
# For backwards compatibility it is still possible to put it into
# ~/.bash_completion or /etc/bash_completion.d/.
