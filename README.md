Programmable completion specification for nfacct (netfilter)

Requirements
==========

The bash completion package version 2.0 or greater is recommended.
https://github.com/scop/bash-completion
If bash completion is present, and the version includes the
**_init_completion()** function, completion on variables and redirection
is available in addition. Otherwise option completion is fully supported,
with the only exception, that object names with spaces are not working.


Installation
============

Quote from bash-completion README:

	Install it in one of the directories pointed to by
	bash-completion's pkgconfig file variables.  There are two
	alternatives: the recommended one is 'completionsdir' (get it with
	"pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion") from which
	completions are loaded on demand based on invoked commands' names,
	so be sure to name your completion file accordingly, and to include
	for example symbolic links in case the file provides completions
	for more than one command.  The other one which is present for
	backwards compatibility reasons is 'compatdir' (get it with
	"pkg-config --variable=compatdir bash-completion") from which files
	are loaded when bash_completion is loaded.

	For packages using GNU autotools the installation can be handled
	for example like this in configure.ac:

	 PKG_CHECK_VAR(bashcompdir, [bash-completion], [completionsdir], ,
	   bashcompdir="${sysconfdir}/bash_completion.d")
	 AC_SUBST(bashcompdir)

	...accompanied by this in Makefile.am:

	 bashcompdir = @bashcompdir@
	 dist_bashcomp_DATA = # completion files go here

	For cmake we ship the bash-completion-config.cmake and
	bash-completion-config-version.cmake files. Example usage:

	 find_package(bash-completion)
	 if(BASH_COMPLETION_FOUND)
	   message(STATUS
		 "Using bash completion dir ${BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR}")
	 else()
	   set (BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR "/etc/bash_completion.d")
	   message (STATUS
		 "Using fallback bash completion dir ${BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR}")
	 endif()

	 install(FILES your-completion-file DESTINATION
	   ${BASH_COMPLETION_COMPLETIONSDIR})

For backwards compatibility it is still possible
to put it into ~/.bash_completion or /etc/bash_completion.d/.

Tip: To make tab completion more handsome put the following into either /etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc:

     set show-all-if-ambiguous on

This will allow single tab completion as opposed to requiring a double tab.

     set page-completions off

This turns off the use of the internal pager when returning long completion lists.
